### Stream
Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
Streams are an update to the Java API that lets you manipulate collections of data in a declarative way (you express a query rather than code an ad hoc implementation for it). For now you can think of them as fancy iterators over a collection of data. In addition, streams can be processed in parallel transparently, without you having to write any multithreaded code

### Date
Java 8 introduced new APIs for Date and Time to address the shortcomings of the older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar.
